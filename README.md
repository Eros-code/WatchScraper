# WatchScraper
The purpose of this project is to scrape new releases of watches from popular brands and compile them all into one place.

Since not everyone can afford most of the more luxurious brand watches, the main focus will be on the lower end budget watches. 

If you are interested, I have included a list of the brands used in this project with their corresponding websites below:
